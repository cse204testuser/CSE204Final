# CSE204Final
A readme for CSE 204

## Welcome to my final project

* The goal of this project was to create a GitHub base social media site that allows users to post thier projects and view other's projects via README writeups.

## Features

* Login using your GitHub account (scopes are set to read profile info only.) This was accomplished using FirebaseAuth
* Upon login your public repos (not inluding those created through another organization like this class) will be displayed on the right of the screen along with a post button.

## Notes
* Readme images must be specified using a url (not just the file location in the repo) to be displayed correctly.
